<p> Provides fundamental classes and interfaces; some of which are either missing from 
    the <code>java.lang</code> package or are not available for all platforms (including J2ME CLDC).</p>
<p> These classes can be moved (refactored) to the <code>java.lang</code> package.
    For example, applications targetting the J2SE 5.0+ run-time exclusively, may move 
    (through global replace) {@link javolution.lang.Appendable Appendable} and 
    {@link javolution.lang.Enum Enum}.</p>
