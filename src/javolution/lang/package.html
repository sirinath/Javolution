<p> Provides fundamental classes and interfaces; some of which are either missing from 
    the <code>java.lang</code> package or are not available for all platforms (including J2ME CLDC).</p>
<p> For application targetting the J2SE 5.0+ run-time (<code>ant 1.5</code>), the 
    <code>Appendable</code> and <code>Enum</code> classes are replaced with the <code>java.lang</code>
    equivalent.</p>
