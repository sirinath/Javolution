<p> Provides a XML {@link javolution.xml.pull.XmlPullParserImpl Pull Parser} which
    does not create objects dynamically; this parser runs on average 2-5x faster
    than (the fastest) conventional XPP parser.</p>
<p> In order to avoid <code>String</code> allocations, the 
    {@link javolution.xml.pull.XmlPullParser XmlPullParser} interface 
    had to be slightly modified with the <code>String</code> replaced by
    the more generic <code>CharSequence</code>.</p>
