    <li><b> Is parsing/formatting of floating-points numbers (e.g. <code>double</code>)
            equivalent to standard String/Double methods?</b>
    <p> With Javolution 4.1, <code>double</code> formatting/parsing is lossless 
        and functionally the same as with the standard library. Parsing a character 
        sequence will always result in the same number whether it is performed with
        {@link javolution.text.TypeFormat TypeFormat} or using <code>Double.parseDouble(String))</code>.
        When formatting a <code>double</code> number, the number of digits output 
        is adjustable. The default (if the number of digits is unspecified) is <code>17</code> 
        or <code>16</code> when the the 16 digits representation  can be parsed back to
        the same <code>double</code> (mimic the standard library formatting).</p>
    <p> Javolution parsing/formatting do not generate garbage and has no adverse
        effect on GC. Better, it does not force the user to create intermediate <code>String</code>
        objects, any <code>CharSequence/Appendable</code> can be used! Serial parsing is also supported 
        (cursor parameter).</p>

    <li><b> I'm accumulating a large string, and all I want to do is 
append to the end of the current string, which is the better class to use, 
Text or TextBuilder? Bearing in mind that speed is important, but I also want 
to conserve memory.</b>
    <p> It all depends of the size of the text to append (the actual size of the
         document being appended has almost no impact in both cases).</p>
    <p> If you append one character at a time or a small text then 
        {@link javolution.text.TextBuilder#append(Object) TextBuilder.append(Object)}
        is faster (the cost of copying the characters to the internal buffer is 
        then negligeable and TextBuilder never resizes its internal arrays).</p>
    <p> If you append larger character sequences (the threshold might be around 20 
        characters) then {@link javolution.text.Text#concat(Text) Text.concat(Text)}
        is more efficient (it avoid character copies, but creates small nodes objects
        instead).</p>
