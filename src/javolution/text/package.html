    <li><b> I'm accumulating a large string, and all I want to do is 
append to the end of the current string, which is the better class to use, 
Text or TextBuilder? Bearing in mind that speed is important, but I also want 
to conserve memory.</b>
    <p> It all depends of the size of the text to append (the actual size of the
         document being appended has almost no impact in both cases).</p>
    <p> If you append one character at a time or a small text then 
        {@link javolution.text.TextBuilder#append(Object) TextBuilder.append(Object)}
        is faster (the cost of copying the characters to the internal buffer is 
        then negligeable and TextBuilder never resizes its internal arrays).</p>
    <p> If you append larger character sequences (the threshold might be around 20 
        characters) then {@link javolution.text.Text#concat(Text) Text.concat(Text)}
        is more efficient (it avoid character copies, but creates small nodes objects
        instead).</p>
